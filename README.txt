CS 3220 - Homework 3
Tuan Khai Tran
README:
The project file is 'homework2' since it was developed based on that
Different From Homework2:
	* 2 New Config Files
	* (Controller) PlayerApiController.java, TeamApiController.java
	* (Model) PlayerDto.java, Team Dto.java,
		CreateTeamRequest.java, CreatePlayerRequest.java

The provided editPlayer.html that professor gave me have the playerId
hardcoded to 1 so I don't change that. Which means this html page just
be able to edit the player with ID number 1.

Plus: I have tried to do fetch to get Team and Player Data to display
and pre-fill onto the html.
